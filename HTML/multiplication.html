    <h2 class="subtitle">Multiplication</h2>
    <p> In math, multiplication is the method of finding the product of two or more numbers. It is a primary
        arithmetic operation that is used quite often in real life. Multiplication is used when we need to <span class="highlight">combine
        groups of equal sizes</span>. Let us learn more about multiplication in this page.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">What is Multiplication?</h3>
    <p> Multiplication is an operation that represents the basic idea of <span class="highlight">repeated addition of the same number</span>. The
        numbers that are multiplied are called <span class="highlight">the factors</span> and the result that is obtained after the multiplication
        of two or more numbers is known as <span class="highlight">the product</span> of those numbers. Multiplication is used to simplify the task
        of repeated addition of the same number.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Example:</h4>
    <p>If there are 6 boxes of cupcakes and each box has 9 cupcakes, find the total number of cupcakes.
    </p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Solution:</h4>
    <p> We can solve this question by addition but it would take longer to add these to get the answer. That is, 9 +
        9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 54 cupcakes. In other words, when we have larger numbers to work upon, then
        multiplication is useful.
        Now, let us use multiplication to solve this problem. We will multiply the number of boxes with the number
        of cupcakes in each box. If we multiply 6 × 9, we will get the total number of cupcakes, which is 6 × 9 = 54
        cupcakes. Thus, we can see that we get the same result in a shorter period of time. This is the reason why
        multiplication is also termed as repeated addition.</p>
